<h1>Image Gallery</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was creating the JavaScript for an application similar to image 
galleries you often see on web pages. Click the thumbnail/name and it's displayed large on the screen with the title.
This was actually kind of fun because a project similar to this one (the carousel) has given me some ideas for a 
web page I'm working on building. It's kind of cool when you can recognize things that might work as building blocks
to bigger projects in the wings. The links point to images stored in the "images" folder and swap them into the position 
of the larger "Gallery" picture and change title when clicked.
